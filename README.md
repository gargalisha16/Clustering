## Sample Results

| Clustering | Preprocessing     | Clusters | Silhouette | Calinski-Harabasz | Davies-Bouldin |
|------------|-------------------|----------|------------|-------------------|----------------|
| KMeans     | none              | 3        | 0.74       | 3567              | 0.34           |
| KMeans     | normalize         | 3        | 0.69       | 6633              | 0.46           |
| Hierarchical | T+N+PCA         | 4        | 0.72       | 3589              | 0.57           |
| MeanShift  | pca               | NA       | 0.67       | 2028              | 0.60           |

## Observations
- PCA sometimes reduces the performance due to dimensionality reduction.
- KMeans performed well with Normalization + PCA.
- Hierarchical methods were stable across preprocessing.
- MeanShift automatically chooses clusters, best when exact `k` is unknown.

## How to Run
1. Open `Clustering_Assignment.ipynb` in Google Colab
2. Run all cells
3. Outputs will be generated including result tables and charts

## âœ… Conclusion
This experiment highlights the importance of data preprocessing and proper evaluation in clustering tasks. Selection of preprocessing technique and algorithm can greatly influence performance.
